# Portfolio Website
A single-page **HTML** that displays some of my projects. 
I wanted to see how far I can get with just pure **CSS** and **JS** (*not that much really*) ,
It's mostly functional but still lacks some responsiveness and still needs to preload as it takes quite some time to fully load the images.
